				Client: Moment Energy

			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				Moment Energy is a clean tech start-up company based in Vancouver that was created by four SFU MSE graduates aimed at creating sustainable energy solutions. They repurpose used batteries into energy storage solutions in aims to reduce landfill impact and mining. At the time of this project, the company had next to no customers. They were struggling with attaining new customers due to limitations regarding certification of their product and a lack of experience to support reliability and trust.

			<figcaption>Many complaints </figcaption>
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				It was immediately clear after preliminary domain research that Spotify was failing to meet the needs of many podcast consumers.  Users expressed gripes with the discoverability of podcasts and issues with the interface.
				If Spotify aims to maintain or increase their podcast dominance, they must adapt their player to be the best for podcasts in addition to music.

				Framing the Problem

				This led us to frame the project around extending Spotify’s audio dominance into podcasting by targeting the audience of engaged podcast listeners.

				Our final solution is a package of three connected features that serves as value added options for users to enhance their podcast consumption experience from directly within the app. These features were carefully designed around the existing app as not to disrupt the existing experience because these features are not for everyone.

				Defining the Audience
			</h2>
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				For the purpose of narrowing down our target audience, we separated podcast listeners into active and passive listeners. Spotify’s audio player is not yet geared towards podcast consumption as it lacks podcast specific features found in other specialized apps. Despite this, passive podcast listeners enjoy having access to podcasts in a convenient spot. However, engaged podcast listeners have more needs while consuming their content, leaving them no choice but to turn to other services.

				Music for Everyone

				Spotify is the leading music streaming platform, and for good reason. Their interface is designed with thoughtful innovation and is supported by powerful algorithms, rendering the music consumption experience completely seamless. Their brand is further defined by their brand values of:

				Implementing Spotify's Brand Values
			</h2>
		
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				It was important for our designs to strictly align with Spotify's core brand values because they were being implemented directly in the same application. We found a large discrepancy in both the quantity and quality of features between the music and podcast sides of Spotify, which extended to both consumption and creation. The resulting experience was problematic because many podcast listeners opted to use other podcast focused apps despite listening to music on Spotify, especially those who sought after value added features that Spotify lacked. We saw the opportunity to discover how Spotify could bridge the gap between

				Subtle Social Qualities
			</h3>
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				Spotify is social, but not in the traditionally loud Web 2.0 format. Spotify is first and foremost an audio player, and they fulfill that role extremely well. The social elements that Spotify has integrated into the app are used to support listeners in their main goal of finding and enjoying music.
			</p>

			<img src="img/casestudy/spotify/research_social.png" class="casestudy_image">
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				Friend activity and group session are social features that sit on the sidelines; users have the option of completely ignoring them with no interruption to the flow of their regular use. However, for those who appreciate the benefits of discovery and directed listening, these features are there to support their needs. Additionally, businesses have created their own form of social content on Spotify by creating playlists that suit their brand.
			</p>
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				The main takeaway from this is that social features should ultimately support the listener’s main goal when using Spotify while remaining unobtrusive to the basic user flow.
