			<p id="casestudy_intro">
				Moment Energy is a Vancouver-based cleantech startup that repurposes used car batteries into energy storage solutions. As of Fall 2020, they were in the early stages of development and implementation, mainly focused on creating a feasible business model and solidifying their technology. Being a startup company selling a large ticket item, Moment Energy ran into issues of lacking trust from potential customers. In an industry where reliability and benefit costs are extremely important to buyers, we explored how technology and interface could support the needs of a young startup battery company.

				Client: Moment Energy
			</h2>
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				 <a href="https://momentenergy.ca/">Moment Energy</a> is a clean tech start-up company based in Vancouver that was created by four SFU MSE graduates aimed at creating sustainable energy solutions. They repurpose used batteries into energy storage solutions in aims to reduce landfill impact and mining. At the time of this project, the company had next to no customers. They were struggling with attaining new customers due to limitations regarding certification of their product and a lack of experience to support reliability and trust.

				Problem Space
			</h2>
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				Moment Energy's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy and reduce the world's diesel dependency. However, as a grassroots cleantech startup, there are many hurdles they must overcome in order to succeed as a business. Among these include:
			</p>
			
			<div class="row">
			  <div class="column3">
				<h4>
					Certification
				</h4>
				<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
					Due to the potential hazards surrounding large energy storage units, customers often only consider certified products. The certification process involves a high upfront cost and locks in the design of the product, two factors that are extremely problematic for a startup company.
				</p>
			  </div>
				
			  <div class="column3">
				<h4>
					Lacking Trust
				</h4>
				<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
					Strong legacies and brands can foster trust between companies and their customers. However, fresh startups do not have this luxury. Instead, they must go the extra mile in terms of product, service, or price. Additionally, clear communication between parties can help ease any worries or problems that occur over time.
				</p>
			  </div>
			  <div class="column3">
				<h4>
					Competition
				</h4>
				<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
					Among energy storage options, the Tesla Powerwall poses extreme constraints on product quality, service, and pricing. Moment Energy must find their competitive edge while developing their product in order to attain sufficient cash flow.

				Research & Process
			</h2>
			
			<h3 class="">
				Understanding Moment Energy's Operations
			</h3>
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				We conducted ethnographic research at Moment Energy. We interviewed the four founders and sat in on their meetings, asking them questions about both internal and external practices.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Methods:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Zoom calls</li>
				<li>Observing team meetings</li>
				<li>Interviews</li>
				<li>Affinity diagrams</li>
				<li>Secondary research</li>
			</ul>
			
			<img src="img/casestudy/moment/affinity_diagram.png" class="casestudy_image">
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				Through this research, we found that internal practices between the four founders was quite strong. However, external communication to prospective customers and markets was difficult due to lack of credibility and lack of certification. Moment Energy is currently unable to prove the value of their product. We used this information to land on our initial design focus:
			</p>
			
			<p class="casestudy_quote">
				Establishing effective communication of Moment Energy’s values to remote communities in order to promote a trusting relationship between them.
			</p>

			
			<h3 class="">
				Reflection + Pivot Point
			</h3>
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				For the first half of the project, we were stuck on this (and similar) design focus which revolved around communication. This was problematic because we did not have access to Moment Energy’s customers and relied on secondary research to back up our claims. This left us with rather empty justifications behind our work. Halfway through our project, we gained access to a few prospective customers and interviewed them over the phone. This allowed us to gain key insights which drove the project forward.

			</p>
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				This was a great lesson because we felt the frustration of working in a space without sufficient research and experienced first-hand how key information can completely make or break a project.
			</p>

			<h3 class="">
				Acquiring Primary Research
			</h3>
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				After many logistical challenges, we were able to gain contact with three of Moment Energy’s prospective customers. These are people who own solar farms or work for contractors that need energy storage solutions. Since we still had a very limited set of players to work with, we conducted thorough interviews with each member in order to gain key insights for our project.

			</p>
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				We found that the prospective customers that we interviewed were extremely enthusiastic about working with Moment Energy due to the environmental benefits and great team, however they require more assurance that the company and product are reliable and will work up to their standards.

			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				After gaining valuable user insights, we were able to move our project into a stronger direction. By combining the several weeks of research, we decided that our intervention should help users:

			<h3 class="">
				Refined Design Focus
			</h3>
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				Using our new, more substantiated research based on prospective customers, we were able to focus in on a refined design focus:

			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				We conducted a participatory workshop with Moment Energy to both share our findings from the user interviews as well as to ensure our design intervention would meet both the needs of the users as well as Moment Energy. This workshop was conducted online (due to the pandemic) via Discord and Figma.

				Workshop Takeaways
			</h2>
			
			<h3 class="">
				The Meaning of ‘Trust’
			</h3>
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				Through design games, we narrowed down what ‘trust’ meant to Moment Energy, and brainstormed how they could deliver on that trust with technology.

			<h3 class="">
				Narrowing Down the User
			</h3>
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				Moment Energy has both business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) relations. As per our research and discussions, we narrowed in on B2C interactions.
			</p>
			
			<h3 class="">
				Confirming our concepts
			</h3>
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				During the H-Form activity, we learned that we were heading in the right direction with our concepts. The Moment Energy Team made further suggestions about possible interactions and refining the audience.

				Defining the Audience
			</h2>
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				For the purpose of narrowing down our target audience, we separated podcast listeners into active and passive listeners. Spotify’s audio player is not yet geared towards podcast consumption as it lacks podcast specific features found in other specialized apps. Despite this, passive podcast listeners enjoy having access to podcasts in a convenient spot. However, engaged podcast listeners have more needs while consuming their content, leaving them no choice but to turn to other services.

				Brand Values

			<h3>
				Music for Everyone
			</h3>
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				Spotify is the leading music streaming platform, and for good reason. Their interface is designed with thoughtful innovation and is supported by powerful algorithms, rendering the music consumption experience completely seamless. Their brand is further defined by their brand values of:

				Implementing Spotify's Brand Values
			</h2>
		
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				It was important for our designs to strictly align with Spotify's core brand values because they were being implemented directly in the same application. We found a large discrepancy in both the quantity and quality of features between the music and podcast sides of Spotify, which extended to both consumption and creation. The resulting experience was problematic because many podcast listeners opted to use other podcast focused apps despite listening to music on Spotify, especially those who sought after value added features that Spotify lacked. We saw the opportunity to discover how Spotify could bridge the gap between

			<h3 class="">
				Subtle Social Qualities
			</h3>
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				Spotify is social, but not in the traditionally loud Web 2.0 format. Spotify is first and foremost an audio player, and they fulfill that role extremely well. The social elements that Spotify has integrated into the app are used to support listeners in their main goal of finding and enjoying music.
			</p>

			<img src="img/casestudy/spotify/research_social.png" class="casestudy_image">
			
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				Friend activity and group session are social features that sit on the sidelines; users have the option of completely ignoring them with no interruption to the flow of their regular use. However, for those who appreciate the benefits of discovery and directed listening, these features are there to support their needs. Additionally, businesses have created their own form of social content on Spotify by creating playlists that suit their brand.
			</p>
			<p class="casestudy_bodytext">
				The main takeaway from this is that social features should ultimately support the listener’s main goal when using Spotify while remaining unobtrusive to the basic user flow.
